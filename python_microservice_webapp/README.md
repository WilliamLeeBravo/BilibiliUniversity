# Python Microservice Web App Development

This small project is used for recapping what I learned on Django and REST. Plus strength the fronted development skills as well.  

The project has a admin site which allows administrator to manage the website content, meanwhile, visitors will be directed to the main site which is like a simplified version on Instagram but cannot post their content. The backend database for this project is MySQL, which can be used as a monitor on the whole project.  

Stack Tools: Django REST framework, Python, RabbitMQ, REACT, Docker, MySQL
